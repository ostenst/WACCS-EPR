# EPR Policy Modeling for Plastic Waste in Sweden 
This repository is dedicated to drafting and simulating models of an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy for plastic waste management in Sweden. The goal is to explore and evaluate various scenarios to identify robust strategies that can inform policy development.

## Features
Scenario Modeling: Utilize the controller.py file to repeatedly call the model.py file and simulate multiple policy scenarios.
Robust Decision Making (RDM): Leverages RDM theory to evaluate the performance of policies across a wide range of uncertain futures, ensuring that outcomes are robust and resilient.
## Repository Structure
controller.py: Manages scenario generation and execution, automating the process of running the model under various conditions.
model.py: Contains the core logic and mathematical representations of the EPR policy and plastic waste flows.
Data: Placeholder or actual datasets used for modeling scenarios.
Results: Outputs from simulations, including scenario performance metrics and insights.
## Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
