# CART SD file
# This file should:
# (1) Apply satisficing thresholds, mainly NPV>0, and re-save the outcomes csv.
# (2) Search for CONDITIONS predicting the satisficing thresholds. Use CART.
# (3) Create and save a new dataset under the identified CONDITIONS - this should be easy to plot later! 
# NOTE: Consider dividing this into 2 scripts... although, since we will not repeat CART too many times (for different plant sizes, or different thresholds) maybe we can stick to 1 file!
